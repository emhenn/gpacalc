# GPA Calculator demo for AngularJS 1

This project is a demo version of a GPA Calculator, written as a way to learn parts of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) v1.  It was started using an [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) template.

The single index page asks for basic biographical info for a student, and lets you enter a letter grade and units for a term and year.

The page sorts the courses entered, calculates and subtotals GPA data per term, year, and overall.  It also offers a print view.

## Using the app

If you are interested in using the app as-is, everything you need is in the /app directory, and you can safely ignore everything else.
